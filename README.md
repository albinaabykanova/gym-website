# The Fit Club

Albina Gym's website is a clean and user-friendly platform for fitness enthusiasts. The layout, color scheme, and font choices are well-coordinated and provide a pleasant browsing experience. The menu options on the top of the page are straightforward, but some of the images in the "Gallery" section at the bottom of the page do not load correctly. The "About Us" section also has a missing image. The "Trainers" page requires clicking on the images to access more information about each trainer, which can be a bit confusing. Additionally, the website experiences slow loading times as the user scrolls down the page. Overall, the website has a great design but would benefit from some improvements to provide a smoother user experience.
